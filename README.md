# Dug technical writing sample

This is the completed assignment for DUG for the role of technical writer. It is build using Docusaurus.

## Additional plugins used

To enhance the user experience, I've added the following plugins:

1. plugin-image-zoom - To allow user to zoom in on images
1. docusaurus-prince-pdf - To build the docs in PDF from the Markdown files. This will then allow user to download the docs in PDF.

I also used the following sites to help me create the docs:

1. https://realfavicongenerator.net/ - To generate Favicon.
1. https://pika.style/ - To create beautiful browser UI.
